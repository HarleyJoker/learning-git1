## C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)

Welcome to the C# extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension provides the following features inside VS Code:

* Lightweight development tools for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io).
* Great C# editing support, including Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, etc.
* Debugging support for .NET Core (CoreCLR). NOTE: Mono debugging is not supported. Desktop CLR debugging has [limited support](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Desktop-.NET-Framework).
* Support for project.json and csproj projects on Windows, macOS and Linux.

The C# extension is powered by [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).

### Requirements

- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) or newer when `omnisharp.useModernNet` is set to `true` (the default value).
- A Full Framework runtime and MSBuild tooling when `omnisharp.useModernNet` is set to `false`.
  - Windows: .NET Framework along with [MSBuild Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)
  - MacOS/Linux: [Mono with MSBuild](https://www.mono-project.com/download/preview/)

### Get Started Writing C# in VS Code

## Announcements

### The C# extension no longer ships with an included Mono & MSBuild Tools

.NET Framework builds of OmniSharp no longer ship with Mono or the MSBuild tooling (See announcement [omnisharp-roslyn#2339](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/2339)). To ensure that the C# extension remains usable out of the box for .NET SDK projects, we have changed the default value of `omnisharp.useModernNet` to `true`.

If you still need Unity or .NET Framework support, you can set `omnisharp.useModernNet` to `false` in your VS Code settings and restart OmniSharp. Please see the [Requirements](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode#requirements) section above to ensure necessary tooling is installed.

See issue [#5120](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/5120) for more details.

### Supported Operating Systems for Debugging

Currently, the C# debugger officially supports the following operating systems:

* X64 operating systems:
    * Windows 7 SP1 and newer
    * macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and newer
    * Linux: see [.NET Core documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2-supported-os.md#linux) for the list of supported distributions. Note that other Linux distributions will likely work as well as long as they include glibc and OpenSSL.
* ARM operating systems:
    * Linux is supported as a remote debugging target

### Found a Bug?
